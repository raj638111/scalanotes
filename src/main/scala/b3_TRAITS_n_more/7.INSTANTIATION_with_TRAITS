Explanation
-------------------------------------------

	# 	Traits can also be added to the Class when the Class is instantiated #182
		This creates an instance class that is anonymous #183
		
	#	Traits are a way to add additional character to a class without changing the 
	 	definition of the class. This is called as **'Dependency Injection' #183
	 	
	#	'extend' keyword cannot be used here. only 'with' keyword can be used #182
	 	A good note here, in last paragraph(Adding traits...) #184	

Example
-------------------------------------------
	 		
	scala> class User(val name: String) {
			def suffix = ""
			override def toString = s"$name$suffix"
		}
		defined class User
		
	scala> trait Attorney { self: User => override def suffix = ", esq." }
		defined trait Attorney
		
	scala> trait Wizard { self: User => override def suffix = ", Wizard" }
		defined trait Wizard
		
	scala> trait Reverser { override def toString = super.toString.reverse }
		defined trait Reverser
		
	scala> val h = new User("Harry P") with Wizard
		h: User with Wizard = Harry P, Wizard
		
	scala> val g = new User("Ginny W") with Attorney
		g: User with Attorney = Ginny W, esq.
		
	scala> val l = new User("Luna L") with Wizard with Reverser
		l: User with Wizard with Reverser = draziW ,L anuL
