Explanation
----------------------------------------

	# 	A class can be couple with Companion object(which has 'apply' method) to create
		a factory pattern #169
	# 	Note : A class can also access the private field of its companion object #170
			
Example
---------------------------------------- 
	#171
	
	scala> :paste
		// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)
		
		object DBConnection {
			private val db_url = "jdbc://localhost"
			private val db_user = "franken"
			private val db_pass = "berry"
			def apply() = new DBConnection
		}
		
		class DBConnection {
			private val props = Map(
				"url" -> DBConnection.db_url,
				"user" -> DBConnection.db_user,
				"pass" -> DBConnection.db_pass
			)
			println(s"Created new connection for " + props("url"))
		}
	// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.
	
	defined object DBConnection
	defined class DBConnection
	
	scala> val conn = DBConnection()
		Created new connection for jdbc://localhost
		conn: DBConnection = DBConnection@4d27d9d
